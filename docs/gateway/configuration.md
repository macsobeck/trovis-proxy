# Gateway Configuration

Controller profiles are stored atomically in `/data/config.json` by default. The file is created
with owner-only permissions (`0600`) and should be backed by a persistent Docker volume. Several
profiles may exist; exactly zero or one is active.

Each profile contains transport, TCP endpoint or serial parameters, upstream Modbus Unit ID,
timeouts, pacing, retry limits, and an optional access key. The API returns only a boolean saying
whether a key exists. An empty key field preserves the stored value; the explicit delete checkbox
removes it. `key_mode` is fixed to `pass-through`, so the stored key is not injected.

Infrastructure settings are deliberately separate:

| Environment | Default | CLI |
|---|---:|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0` | `--listen-host` |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | `7112` | `--listen-port` |
| `ADMIN_ADDRESS` | `127.0.0.1` | `--admin-host` |
| `ADMIN_PORT` | `8080` | `--admin-port` |
| `GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` | `/data/config.json` | `--config-path` |
| `MODBUS_TRACE` | `0` | `--modbus-trace` |

The connection test opens and closes the selected TCP transport without sending a Modbus PDU.
For Serial RTU it verifies that the configured device path exists, again without a request.
